Exploranium GR-100 Radiation Detector Control
------------------------------------------------------------------------

GR-100 is quite old, but still cool device with on-board CsI(Tl) and
LiI scintillation detectors. Everything is cool except the support
software being locked down on Windows (and quite frankly, feels like
a high school student project with all the forms and buttons).

This project talks to GR-100 via RS-232 in the same fashion. The benefits
are obvious: a) you can hack on the code; b) you can run this code on
multitude of platforms (I would go for Python, but Java seems to offer
enough functionality to do this in less messier fashion).

Quick-start:
  $ mvn clean install

...or grab the binary bundle from here:
